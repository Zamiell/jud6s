								<h2>What Is It?</h2>
							</header>

							<p>This is a mod that stays very close to the original game while slightly tweaking it to be more fair for racing. It also fixes a ton of bugs that the developers have not bothered to fix in the vanilla game.</p>
							<p>This mod is commonly used while racing on <a href="http://www.speedrunslive.com/races/game/#!/isaacafterbirth/1">SpeedRunsLive</a> and is also chosen for many tournaments, such as <a href="http://roidragetv.weebly.com">Roid Rage</a> and Balls of Steel.</p>

								<h2>Installation & Uninstallation</h2>
							</header>

							<p>If you are using the Isaac Racing Mods package, it will automatically handle installing and uninstalling the mod for you. Otherwise, see the instructions below for your respective operating system.</p>

							<p><h3>Windows</h3></p>

							<p>After unzipping the zip file to a new directory, double click on the "INSTALL (Windows)" script. It will take care of everything for you. (This script can also be used to uninstall the mod.)</p>
							<p>Alternatively, you can manually install the mod by copying all of the files in the "resources" directory to:<br />
							<code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\resources\</code><br />
							<p>To go back to an unmodded game, delete everything in the resources directory except for the "packed" directory.</p>

							<p><h3>Mac & Linux</h3></p>

							<p>After unzipping the mod files, you should see a "resources" subdirectory. Install the mod by copying the contents of that directory into your Isaac resources directory. On Mac, this is typically:<br />
							<code>/Users/[your-user-name]/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/the binding of isaac/The Binding Of Isaac.app/Content/Resources/resources/</code></p>

								<h2>Ruleset</h2>

							<p class="before-ul">The mod is meant to be played:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>with Judas</li>
								<li>on normal mode</li>
								<li>with the BLCK CNDL seed ("total curse immunity")</li>
								<li>on a "1001%" save file (which is a save file that has everything in the game unlocked)</li>
							</ul>

							<p>If don't already have one, you can <a href="http://www.speedrun.com/saves/fully_unlocked_afterbirth_save_k5imn.zip">download a 1001% save file from Speedrun.com</a>.</p>

								<h2>Mod Changes</h2>
							</header>

							<p class="before-ul">1. Judas is tweaked:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Judas starts with the D6. (All other characters also start with the D6, except for Eve, Eden, and Keeper, as it isn't possible.)</li>
								<li>Judas starts with half a soul heart in addition to his 1 red heart container (so that he can consistently take a devil deal).</li>
								<li>Judas starts with a bomb instead of 3 coins (so that he can get Treasure Room pedestal items surrounded by rocks).</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">2. Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms are buffed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Devil Rooms and Angel Rooms without item pedestals in them have been removed.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">3. Some items with no effect are removed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>the Karma trinket (all Donation Machines are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)</li>
								<li>the Amnesia pill (all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)</li>
								<li>the ??? pill (all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed)</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">4. Cutscenes are removed.</p>
							<p class="before-ul">5. Some useless animations are removed:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>cowering in the fetal position at the beginning of every floor</li>
								<li>jumping in a hole to the next floor</li>
								<li>going up the beam of light to the Cathedral</li>
								<li>entering a chest when going to The Chest or beating the game</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">6. Some death animations are shortened:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Boss death animations that are longer than 1 frame are set to 1 frame.</li>
								<li>The Satan death animation is set to 30 frames.</li>
								<li>Krampus, Uriel, Gabriel, and It Lives are unchanged.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">7. Some bug fixes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Charge animations with transformations now work.</li>
								<li>Many rooms with unavoidable damage or bugs have been fixed or deleted. Full documentation can be found on <a href="room_changes.html">the Room Changes page</a>.
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">8. Lag reduction:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fog has been removed to help eliminate lag on slower computers and make the game clearer to see.</li>
								<li>A <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/250900/discussions/0/613941122558099449/">config.ini file</a> has been included to disable some graphical effects, such as the water on Flooded Caves. If you already have a config.ini in your resources directory, the Isaac Racing Mods program (or the "INSTALL (Windows).bat" file) will not bother copying one over. If you don't like the way that the config.ini makes the game look, leave the file it in your resources directory and make the contents completely blank.</p>

								<li>Deleted the Seeded Dark Room ruleset.</li>
								<li>Fixed a near-unavoidable L-shaped Womb room where a Blastocyst spawned too close to the door.</li>
								<li>Removed an empty room from the Cathedral.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">1.23 - May 20th</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fixed 3 rooms that soft-locked Technology builds.</li>
								<li>Fixed 9 rooms that soft-lock low-range builds.</li>
								<li>Removed 2 empty rooms from Sheol.</li>
								<li>Removed Book of Sin from the seeded rulesets.</li>

								<li>Fixed the bug where the It Lives death animation was improperly taken out of the Lost Child Open ruleset.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">1.22 - April 18th</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Removed the Basement/Cellar puzzle room with the red fires along the sides, as it is sometimes unavoidable damage.</li>
								<li>Removed the Karma trinket from the game, since all Donation Machines are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed.</li>
								<li>Removed the Amnesia and ??? pill from the game, since all curses are removed on the BLCK CNDL seed.</li>
								<li>Removed the Cain's Eye trinket from the game on the seeded rulesets, since starting with The Compass makes it have no effect.</li>

It will only be installed if you install the mod with the provided installer script. This file tells the game to disable certain graphical effects, such as the water on Flooded Caves. This helps eliminate lag on slower computers and makes the game clearer to see. If you already have a config.ini in your resources directory, then the installer script will not bother copying anything over. If you don't like the way that the config.ini makes the game look, simply delete the file from your resources directory.</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Removed the More Options mode, since nobody uses it anymore.</li>
								<li>Reverted the skull change in the Depths/Necropolis bomb puzzle room, as it doesn't actually stop spikes from spawning on Dank Depths. If you get spikes spawning on a critical path and you don't have flying, you are pretty much screwed.</li>

								<li>Fixed an unavoidable damage room with explosive champion Lumps in the Womb.</li>

							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">1.19 - March 9th</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Fixed an unavoidable damage room with double Gurdy in Utero.</li>

							<ul>
								<li>Reverted the death animation removal for It Lives, which fixes the bug with the death tears.</li>
								<li>Fixed an unavoidable damage room with a Mulligan in the Basement.</li>
								<li>Fixed an unavoidable damage room with a Maggot in the Caves.</li>
								<li>Removed the useless room with the donation machine in Necropolis.</li>

								<li>Reorganized the ruleset numbers.</li>
								<li>Fixed the door on Basement/Cellar room #772.</li>
								<li>Fixed the bug where the Pony and the White Pony do not show if the player has certain transformations.</li>
								<li>Added a new ruleset for The Lost Child Open loser's bracket. Blue Baby now starts with a bomb and an extra half soul heart. Judas Shadow and Lazarus' Rags are removed from all pools.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">1.14 - January 24th</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Teleport! and Undefined have been removed from all pools in the seeded mode.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="before-ul">1.13 - January 21st</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The Windows installation script will now attempt to automatically find your "resources" directory using Steam, which means it will now work if you have Isaac installed in a non-standard place. (Thanks to Ipn for this.)</li>
